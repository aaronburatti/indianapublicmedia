# IndianaPublicMedia mobile app

This is an android app. It was built in conjuction with class CS I348 and RTVS. The original repo is https://github.iu.edu/aburratt/Buratti_IPM, 
however, it is behind the IU central login in wall so I cloned the repo. 

The app is focused around media produced by WFIU, WTIU, and the digital content producers. It listed 20 recent news stories, broadcasted our two radion stations,
and pulled vids from our youtube channels. It also allowed a user to save articles in a DB and view them later.
